For example, the coefficient for fbs (fasting blood sugar level above 120 mg/dl) is 2.671585, suggesting that having a high fasting blood sugar level increases the risk of heart disease.\n",

    "Zero Coefficient: A coefficient of zero means that the feature has no effect on the target variable. Many features in your results have a coefficient of zero, indicating that they do not influence the risk of heart disease.\n",

    "Percentage Impact: This shows the relative importance of each feature in the model’s total impact. Features with a high percentage impact play a more critical role in the model's decisions. For example:\n",

    "Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Impactful Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar): With the highest positive coefficient, this feature suggests that a higher fasting blood sugar level is likely to increase the risk of heart disease. It is an important factor to consider in healthcare.\n",

    "ca (Coronary Angiography): A significant positive coefficient indicates that this condition might also contribute to an increased risk of heart disease.\n",

    "Negative Impact Features:\n",

    "magnesium_level: The negative coefficient indicates that as magnesium levels increase, the risk of heart disease decreases. High magnesium levels may serve as a positive indicator for heart health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features with No Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several features show a coefficient of zero, meaning these variables do not contribute to the prediction of heart disease risk. This lack of influence suggests that they may not be relevant in the context of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the analysis shows that fasting blood sugar level (fbs) and coronary angiography (ca) are critical factors in predicting heart disease risk, while magnesium levels appear to have a protective effect. Many other features do not have a significant influence, which can inform future modeling and feature selection efforts."
